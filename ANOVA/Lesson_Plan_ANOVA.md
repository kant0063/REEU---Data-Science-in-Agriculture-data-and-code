# Lesson Plan: Introduction to ANOVA

**Rationale: ANOVA (analysis of variance) is a foundational experimental technique.** 
*Student Learning Objectives* 
Students will…. 
    1. Understand variation within treatments
    2. Understand variation between treatments
    3. Understand mean separation
*Materials Needed for Lesson*
    • Laptop
    • Internet
**Anticipatory Set up time (5 min)**
# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
    1. What is a distribution?
    2. What is a mean?
**Direct instruction and guided practice**
## Activity 1: Comparing genotypes (10 min)
        a. Students will first attend the lecture on ANOVA
        b. Download a dataset of interest:
*U’ala (9a)*
*Kalo (9b)*
        c. Download the R markdown
        d. What is a trait?
        e. What is variation?
        f. How many ways can you measure variation?
## Activity 2: Conduct the ANOVA(30 min)
        a. Write a linear model for the comparison
        b. Plot the results
## Activity 3: Discuss the difference between ANOVA and Regression (15 min)
        a. How do you see the difference between ANOVA and Regression?
        b. What are the goals?
# Independent Practice 
## Homework Assignment: With your partner, write a one-paragraph essay on why are crop wild relatives important?
