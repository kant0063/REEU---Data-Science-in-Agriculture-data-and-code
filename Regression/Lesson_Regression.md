# Lesson Plan: Regression 
**Rational: One of the most fundamental techniques in statistics is regression. 
Regression is a technique that is used to both understand relationships between variables and to be able to predict 
what future observations will look like.**  
# Student Learning Objectives 
*Students willâ€¦.*\ 
1) Understand the mechanics of creating a regression model
2) Understand how to visualize a regression model

# Materials Needed for Lesson
1) Laptop
2) Drybean_dataset.csv
3) Drybean_regression.Rmd 
*Anticipatory Set up time* 

# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
1) What is a mean?
2) What is variation?
3) What is a prediction?
4) What is error?
5) Is error bad?

# Direct instruction and guided practice
## Activity 1: Exploration of simple regression
1) Students will first attend the lecture on regression
2) Import the dry bean dataset
3) Download R markdown
4) Explore two variables
5) Create a best fit line
6) Create a confidence and prediction interval

## Activity 2: Multiple regression
1) Use multiple predictors to create a prediction
2) Identify which predictor explains the most variance

## Activity 3: Discussion of the techniques
1) Discuss how regression can be used to explore different contexts
2) Annotate code in your own words 

# Independent Practice 

**Try your new code on a new dataset**
Output:  R-markdown for regression annotated in **
