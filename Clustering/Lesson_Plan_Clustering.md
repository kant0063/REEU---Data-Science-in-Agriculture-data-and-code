# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Clustering
**Rationale: When every sample has been measured for many different variables, it becomes important to group things by similarity of all the overall measurements. 
There are many ways that people have done this. In this lesson, students will be exposed to two such methods.** 
*Student Learning Objectives* 
Students will…. 
    1. Explore a dataset
    2. Be able to implement PCA in R
    3. Be able to implement k-means clustering in R
# Materials Needed for Lesson
        ◦ Laptop
        ◦ Data files - Dry_Bean_Dataset.csv and all_years_roots_final.csv
        ◦ R-markdown templates - Drybean_Nearest_neighbor.rmd, Drybean_Visualization_clustering.rmd and Drybean_Hyperplanes.Rmd
**Anticipatory Set up time (5 min)**
# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
    1. How do you know if samples are related?
    2. How can you see patterns in data?
# Direct instruction and guided practice
## Activity 1: Principal component analysis K-means clustering
    1. Download R markdown for clustering
    2. Visually explore the data
    3. Conduct the PCA
    4. Graph the different PCs
    5. Color the potential groups 
    6. Cluster the data into different numbers of groups
    7. Graph the output in at least two different ways

## Activity 2: Nearest neighbor
    1. Download R markdown for nearest neighbor
    2. Now explore nearest neighbors
    3. Try it with the PCA output

# Independent Practice 
*Practice clustering on a maize root dataset* 
*Output:*  R-markdown annotated with your own understanding of what each line of code does.  
*Follow up / Homework*
At the beginning of the next class, have students share their thoughts and what they learned during the lesson and some of the opinions about how to make code readable.
