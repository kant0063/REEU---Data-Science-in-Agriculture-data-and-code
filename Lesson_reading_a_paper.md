# Lesson Plan: Discussing scientific literature
**Rationale: Publishing scientific findings is paramount to research. It is important for students to understand the process of going from forming a question, to identifying a testable hypothesis, to creating visualiztions, to writing the story of your data.**

# Student Learning Objectives 
Students will…   
1) Understand the structure and style of a scientific paper
2) Identify the key findings of the paper
3) Describe the paperʻs strengths and weaknesses

# Materials Needed for Lesson
1) PDF of papers of interest to the instructor
2) Internet   
*Anticipatory Set up time (15 min)*

# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
1) What is a scientific paper?
2) Have you seen or read one before

# Independent Practice 
## Homework Assignment: Read the assigned papers. Be prepared to discuss the papers with your peers and mentors.
1) Download the peer-reviewed papers to read prior to the discussion
2) Highlight key findings (directly on the PDF or handwritten)
3) Write down any questions that you would like to ask for clarification
4) Come prepared to discuss
## Direct instruction and guided practice
**Activity 1: Discussing scientific literature**

3) Be able to state a strength and a weakness
4) Be able to answer and ask questions from/to your mentors and peer
