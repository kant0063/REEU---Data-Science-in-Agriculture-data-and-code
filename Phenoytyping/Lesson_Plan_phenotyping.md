# Lesson Plan: Leaf Phenotype 
**Rationale: Phenotyping and measuring important traits is key to being able to make reliable inferences. 
In this lesson, we will learn how to process leaf samples so that useful measurements can be taken. 
We will use the phenotyping data in our machine learning exercise to classify and predict plant type based on its traits.**

# Student Learning Objectives 
Students will…. 
1) Understand that the process of taking leaf samples
2) Understand measurement techniques
3) Understand how to record measurements

# Materials Needed for this Lesson
1) Leaf Phenotyping protocol
2) Plants at the right growth stage

# Student Activity 1 
**Extracting leaves from plants**

# Student Activity 2
**Analyzing leaf**

*Anticipatory Set up time (5 min)*

# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
1) What is a plant?
2) What is a leaf?
3) What is a plantʻs growth rate?
4) Why do we use a specific leaf?

# Direct instruction and guided practice
**Activity 1** Student will first attend lecture
**Activity 2** Measuring leaves 
    1) Divide students into groups and pass out protocol
    2) Bring in a practice set of plants
        a) Measure the leaf
        b) Record the data
**Activity 3** Play with the data 
    1) Create a plot with the data

# Independent Practice 
*List places where the protocol was easy for you and what was difficult.*
*Explore the growth rate of papaya - http://plant-growth-analysis.rcac.purdue.edu*
**Output:**  Students should start a datasheet that allows them to collect leaf data for the rest of the term. We will work with the appropriate data spreadsheet templates: 
    1) daily L4 measurements
    2) terminal shoot data
# Follow up / homework
*At the beginning of the next class, have students share their thoughts and what they 
learned during the lesson and some of the opinions on how to optimize the protocol (3 min).*
