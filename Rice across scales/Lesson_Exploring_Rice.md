# Lesson Plan: Understanding Rice Yield across scale (Getting acquainted with R)
**Rationale:** *Rice is one of the most important crops across the world. When we look at the spatial and temporal changes in rice production. When exploring data across scale, it is possible to pick up signals of biological phenomenon. Using the spatiotemporal data students will identify signals of disease, climate, and abiotic stress.* 

# Student Learning Objectives 
1) Understand how food production has changed over time
2) Understand the Role of scale on food production
3) Explore signals of disease epidemics and abiotic stress
4) Explore signals of socio ecological impacts
# Materials Needed for Lesson
1) Lecture
2) Data file - Rice_yield_FAO.xlsx
3) R markdown file - Workshop 3 Rice_Data.Rmd
4) Maps
5) Botanical illustrations of rice
6) Cropping Calendar
7) Laptop
## Student Activity 1: Describe Rice Yield Maps
1) What does a rice plant look like?
2) How is rice grown?
3) What climate factors impact rice growth?
4) What is the difference between region, country, and provincial data?

## Student Activity 2: Create time series of yield graphs
1) How has yield changed overtime?
2) How has yield changed in different geographies? 

## Student Activity 3: Combine spatial and temporal data
1) How is time and space combined to change yield?
2) What factors have influenced yield (abiotic, biotic, socioeconomic)?\
   **Anticipatory Set up time (5 min)**

# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
1) What impacts crop yield?
2)  What factors impact yield in different geographies?
3)   What factors impact yield in different times?\
*Use example pictures, Rice terraces, dryland rice, Internaional Rice Research Institute (IRRI)*
# Direct instruction and guided practice
## Activity 1: Describe Rice yield maps
1) Divide students into 3-5 groups and pass out maps of different countries\
  a) What factors impact yield in the different countries? \
  b) What is the cropping calendar?\
  c) What are the important biological factors that can impact yield?
## Activity 2: Create time series graphs of yield
1) In the same 3-5 groups and hand out datasets for different countries\
  a) Have groups load data into R\
  b) Create time series graphs of yield\
  c) Create a trendline\
  d) What could have caused variation around the trendline?
## Activity 3: Combine spatial and temporal data
1) After each group reports, have student explore the space and time data together
2) Ask students to explore major disease epidemics in the countries they have been assigned?
3) Ask students to explore major policy interventions in the countries they have been assigned?
4) What might change these trends in the future?

# Independent Practice 
**Homework Assignment:** Write a three-paragraph essay on rice agroecosystem sustainability given the spatiotemporal data explored. 
**Output:** Essays should demonstrate that students understand the concept of how time and space impact the agroecosystem. They should also be able to give well-founded opinions as to the significance of biotic and abiotic stress.
# Follow up / Homework
*At the beginning of the next class, have students share their thoughts and what they learned during the 
lesson and some of the opinions that they wrote in their homework essays.*
