# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Support Vector Machines 
**Rationale: The classification of information is critical to understanding biological diversity. Here, we introduce support vector machines as a way of classifying data. Often there are large amounts of data that are represented by many different measurements, the use of SVM helps the researcher classify unknown observations.**
# Student Learning Objectives 
1) Understand how to implement SVM in R
2) Understand the goals of classification
3) Interpret information regarding variables that impact classification 

# Materials Needed for Lesson
1) Laptop
2) Access to Internet
3) Draybean_dataset.csv
   
# Anticipatory Set up time: Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
1) How do we classify things?
2) How many different types of data do we have?
3) What are some alternative ways of classifying things?

# Direct instruction and guided practice
## Student Activity 1: Explore the bean data
1) Load in bean data into R
2) Create a visualization of the data
3) Share your visualization and code with the class
## Student Activity 2: Create a support vector machine to classify bean genotypes
1) Load in bean data into R
2) Explore and annotate the R-markdown SVM code
3) Create a confusion table
4) Describe the results to your group members
## Student Activity 3: Class discussion
1) What other problems can the classification method be used for?
2) What other types of data could be used?
3) How does this help influence how we explore the landscape?
# Independent Practice 
**Use the Maize leaf shape data to create a new confusion matrix to classify genotypes**\
**Output:**  Students will bring a confusion matrix of classification to the next class
Follow up: At the beginning of the next class, have students share their thoughts and what they learned during the lesson and how well their classification worked.
