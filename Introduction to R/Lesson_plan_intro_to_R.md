# Lesson Plan: Introduction to R
**Rationale: It is essential for the students to be able to interact with the statistical software R. 
This software is a free statistical software that is a common tool for biological data analysis.** 
# Student Learning Objectives 
*Students willâ€¦* 
    1) Download R
    2) Download Rstudio
    3) Understand how to type a command into the command line
    4) Understand how to import data into R
    5) Understand how to find a manual page
# Materials Needed for Lesson
1) Laptop Computer
2) Internet
**Anticipatory Set up time (5 min)*

# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
    1) What is the command line?
    2) What is scripting?
    3) Why are computers useful?
    4) What are variables?
*Introduce the concept of data and data visualization* 

# Direct instruction and guided practice
## Activity 1: Download R and R studio
    1) Divide students into 4 groups
    2) Give the links to the key websites to download software
    3) Give the links to data
        a) Walk students through installing and loading a library
        b) Introduce R-markdown
        c) Introduce commenting code
        d) Walk students through importing data
        e) Walk students through creating a graph
## Activity 2: Learning independently to upload new data a create a new graph
    1) Give the students a new dataset
    2) Allow students time to create a new graphic
    3) Have students share their graphic and describe it
    4) Discuss questions about data? 
        a) What is data? 
        b) How do figures represent data?
        c) How can figures represent specific ideas?

## Independent Practice 
1) *Make a second set of graphs based on the second dataset, change color, change shape, change grouping.* 
2) **Output:**  A set of 4-5 graphics and a new R-markdown document. 
## Follow up 
*At the beginning of the next class, students will share their graphs and their interpretation*
