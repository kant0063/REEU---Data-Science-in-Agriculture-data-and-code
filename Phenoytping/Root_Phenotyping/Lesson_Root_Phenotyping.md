# Lesson Plan: Root Phenotype 
**Rationale: Phenotyping is key to being able to make any reliable inferences about the root traits among different plants. 
In this lesson, we will learn how to process samples so that useful measurements can be taken.**  
# Student Learning Objectives 
Students willâ€¦. 
1) Understand that the process of taking root samples
2) Understand how to use the scanning software
3) Understand how to take measurements with the software

# Materials Needed for Lesson
1) Root Phenotyping protocol
2) High resolution Scanner
3) Rhizovision software
4) Plants at the right growth stage
5) Student Activity 1
    a) Extracting Roots from plants
6) Student Activity 2
    a) Scanning roots
7) Student Activity 3
    a) Analyzing roots

**Anticipatory Set up time (50 min)**

# Gauge how comfortable students are with the material with a series of warm-up questions, for example:
1) What is soil?
2) What is a root?
3) How many different types of root structures exist?
4) Why is it hard to study roots

# Direct instruction and guided practice
**Activity 1: Students will first attend lecture**
**Activity 2: Extracting Roots** 
    1) Divide students into groups and pass out protocol
    2) Bring in a practice set of plants
        a) Dissect the plants
        b) Wash the roots
**This Activity 3: Scan the roots (30 min)**
    1) Prior to coming to class, please make sure to do the following:
        a) Familiarize yourself with the software by carefully reading the manual (see protocol link).
        b) Mac users: You will need to download and install a Windows emulator: https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/trial-t/ prior to being able to install the RhizoVision software (it only runs on Windows). You will need to sign up for a 2 weeks Parallels trial, but you'll be done with the phenotyping portion after about 10 days. Once you have successfully installed Parallels, you can follow step 3 below to install your RhizoVision software. The parallels and Windows packages are pretty large so make sure you have enough bandwidth to do it. I recommend doing it on campus.
        c) Windows users: Download and install the software following the instructions on this page: https://zenodo.org/record/4095629
    2) In class, we will go through the steps to successfully phenotype the roots following the protocol, but make sure you refer to the manual for any detailed info.
    3) Get the software working and scan the roots
    4) Play with the software features
    5) Output data 
    6) Download data to adhere to the data template

# Independent Practice 
*List places where the protocol was easy for you and what was difficult.* 
**Output:**  Students should start a datasheet that allows them to collect root data for the rest of the term. 

# Follow up / Homework
*At the beginning of the next class, have students share their thoughts and what they learned during the lesson and some of 
the opinions on how to optimize the protocol (3 min).*
